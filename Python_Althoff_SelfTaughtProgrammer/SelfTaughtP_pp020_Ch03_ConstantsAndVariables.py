# Basic math:
print("2+2")
print("2-2")
print("4/2")
print("2*2")

# Variable are containers for values that allow the values to change
# Constants are similar, but the value never changes after it's created

# Changing a variable's value
x = 100
print(x)

x = 200
print(x)

# Doing math with variables
x = 15
y = 10
z = x - y
print(z)

# Incrementing and decrementing variables
c = 5
d = 7
c = c + 1
d -= 1

if (c == d):
    print("x = x + 1 and x += 1 are the same")

# Variables can be any data type
my_string = "This is a string"
my_int = 42
my_float = 5.54
print(my_string, my_int, my_float)
