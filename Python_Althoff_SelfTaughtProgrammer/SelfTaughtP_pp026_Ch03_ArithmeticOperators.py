# Arithmetic Operators in Python:
print("Exponent: 2 * 2 = ", 2 * 2)
print("Modulo/remainder: 14 % 4 = ", 14 % 4)
print("Integer division/floored quotient: 13 // 8 = ", 13 // 8)
print("Division: 13 / 8 = ", 13 / 8)
print("Multiplication: 8 * 2 = ", 8 * 2)
print("Addition: 2 + 2 = ", 2 + 2)

# Order of operations in Python is the same as in math:
#    - Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.
#    - Multiplication ties with division, addition ties with subtraction.
#    - In the case of a tie, evaluate left-to-right.
